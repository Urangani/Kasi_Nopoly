# Kasi Nopoly 🎲

Kasi Nopoly is a township-inspired board game project,
modeled after Monopoly but with a unique kasi (local township) flavor.
Players buy properties, hustle for cash, and navigate community events — 
all while trying to avoid bankruptcy and become the ultimate kasi mogul.

## Game Vision
- Bring kasi culture into a fun, interactive board game.
- Blend traditional Monopoly mechanics with local twists (spaza shops, taxis, braais).
- Create a digital version that is playable online or offline.
